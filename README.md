# CodeRed

CodeRed is an app I built as a joke in response to a meme in the H3 Podcast. The app represents a device similar to life alert, but istead, it's used to ward off people named Dominique or James or other people you don't like..   
 
CodeRed was coded using the Java programing language and the Android Studio architecture. Sound effects were edited on Audacity and images were edited on GIMP.
